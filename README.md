# Chief-Queef-Mapping-Files
Original files/scripts from the Chief Queef Beat Saber charts. 

"Chief Queef" was an alt account that I used to first learn notemods and effects in Beat Saber using Noodle Extensions.
Each chart really focuses on one main aspect/gimmick or a new feature that was added at the time. 

I still go back to these scripts as a reference for charts that I'm currently working on, so I figured I'd post them up here as well for others to pick apart and see how things are done. 

DISCLAIMER: When I was making this, I was starting with literally ZERO experience with any kind of scripting or coding. 
This code is very rough, but it was very readable and simple for my smooth slippery brain to understand. 
If you know better practices, cool! Use them yourself!
Otherwise, everythything seen here might be "inefficient", but it works and is relatively easy to understand for someone with zero experience.
